%% MULTICLASS AND MULTIVARIATE CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLE
%% Codes are written in MATLAB R2015a, please use R2015a or a later version to run this project

% This project contains codes for face recognition using KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers
% As an example of the face data set, the publicly available AT&T Database created by AT&T Laboratories Cambridge has been used 
% Download Link of AT&T Database: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html


% Steps to run the project succesfully
% 1. Download the database
% 2. store the extracted directory (att_faces) in currect directory
% 3. run create_datbase() function, it will create the face dataset in matrix format with ground truths
% 4. run Face_Recog_KNN script for face recognition using KNN classifier
% or/and
% 4. run Face_Recog_Bayes script for face recognition using Naive Bayes classifier
% 5. View the reported the Error rate and correct classification rates in Tabular form


% The other classification techniques such as classify, fitcdiscr can be used in similar way
%##HAPPY CODING##
